                    These are kicks from NB, yes the New Balance, they are known as dad shoes too but these are too hot
                    to
                    be limited to just dads.

                    These are from the value champion brand (at least in my opinion) PUMA! they look cool, they feel
                    comfy
                    and hold up well without breaking your bank.

                    These are my favs from NIKE! although they have a steep price tag yet not so high end quality, but
                    they
                    look sick and that's all.

                    Lastly we have AJ4 BREDs! these go hard, look great, are expensive yet high quality too. I saw these
                    in
                    a webtoon first named WindBreaker and these are cool AF.

                of shoes. When I
                discovered the AJ4s on this website, I knew my quest
                had come to an end. Whether I'm battling frost giants or simply
                taking a stroll through Asgard, these shoes never fail me. The AJ4s are truly worthy of a god. Highly
                recommended!”</p>
